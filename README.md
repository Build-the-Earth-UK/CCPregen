### Usage

Note that all coordinates listed below are given in blocks, not cubes. Coordinate conversion is handled automatically.

CCPregen is pretty simple to use. It adds a single command, unimaginatively named `/ccpregen`.  
To pregenerate a 500Â³ block cube starting at (0,0,0):  
`/ccpregen 0 0 0 500 500 500`

To pregenerate a 300 block wide+tall, 1000 block long tunnel in the nether:  
`/ccpregen -150 0 0 149 300 1000 -1`

As this is a really simple mod, you currently can't have multiple pregeneration tasks running at once. Use `/ccpregen_stop` to abort an ongoing pregeneration task, and `/ccpregen_pause` and `/ccpregen_resume` to pause/resume pregeneration.
